History shows that severe illness and death rates tend to be higher for racial and ethnic minority populations during public health emergencies than for other populations. Addressing the needs of these populations in emergencies includes improving day-to-day life and harnessing the strengths of these groups. Shared faith, family, and cultural institutions are common sources of social support. These institutions can empower and encourage individuals and communities to take action to prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who become sick, and help community members cope with stress.

CDC has developed resources to help local resources to help local communities, schools, faith-based organizations and other groups and the people they serve during a pandemic.
    Working with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments and healthcare systems to collect data on the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and to understand which groups may be more at risk. This information can be used to better direct resources and care to address health disparities.
    Supporting partnerships between researchers, professional groups, community groups, tribal medicine leaders, and community members to share information to prevent COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority communities.
    Providing considerations on how to prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 in schools, workplaces, and communities, including organizations serving racial and ethnic minority groups. Collect, analyze, and report data in ways that shed light on health disparities and drive solutions.
Communicate often about COVID-19 and its impact on racial and ethnic minority communities in ways that are  transparent and credible.
Work with other sectors, such as faith, community, education, business, transportation, housing organizations, and spiritual and other leaders to share information and find ways to reduce social and economic barriers to slowing the spread of COVID-19.
Train community health workers in underserved communities and tribal areas to educate and link people to free or low-cost health services.
Link people to testing and care for COVID-19.
Link more people to healthcare services for serious medical conditions, some of which increase the risk of getting severely ill and dying from COVID-19. For example, link people to services to access affordable medicines or to help follow care plans.
