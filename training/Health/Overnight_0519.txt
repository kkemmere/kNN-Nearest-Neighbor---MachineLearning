Welcome to Tuesday's Overnight Health Care.
President Trump doubled down on his use of hydroxychloroquine, a new study suggests that the number of Americans who die from COVID-19 will triple by the end of the year, and South Korea is changing its protocols on testing after a study showed people who get "reinfected" with COVID-19 are not contagious.

Trump defends hydroxychloroquine use after meeting with GOP senators
President Trump headed to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a meeting with GOP senators, but it was his controversial use of hydroxychloroquine that drew the focus of questions from reporters after.
"I think it gives you an additional level of safety," Trump told reporters. "But you can ask many doctors who are in favor of it. Many front-line workers won't go there unless they have the hydroxy."
"This is an individual decision to make," he added. "But it's had a great reputation and if it was somebody else other than me people would say, 'Gee isn't that smart.'"
Warnings: His declaration that he started taking it over a week ago was cause for alarm for medical experts given the drug's unproven efficacy and known potential side effects.
The FDA issued a warning last month that hydroxychloroquine should not be taken outside of a hospital or clinical trial because of the risk of severe heart problems.
