# kNN(Nearest-Neighbor) Machine Learning introduction
<br/>
IoT project using kNN based algorithm written in Python<br/><br/>
One of my favorite projects I completed for my B.S. Fundamentally this program simply compares one input article to a set of training data and percieves the input article as similar to a section of training articles. (Depending on the training articles contained in the "training" file that will determine your result)<br/><br/>

Input articles are in "testing" folder and must be taken out of folder before use. (Program currently doesnt search the testing folder)<br/><br/>
